Module 4 Challenge

We are the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district. 
In this capacity, we'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 

Our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

As our analysis mentions: Charter schools score better average scores than District schools. This isnt becasue of a lack of budget spending. as budget per student for district students is higher than charter ones. We believe this gap is because of the size of students in classrooms. As theres a direct relation between bigger classrooms and lower scores. Our solution would be ot implement more math teachers and classrooms. Get the number of students per math classroom from Charter schools, and try to get as close to that number ass possible for district schools. A smaller classroom will allow teachers to pace themselves, and make sure no student is left without comprehending the material. We suggest to implement this first on Math classes as there is a bigger discrepency in Math scores between district and charter schools, and if still within budget, do the same with Reading classes where there is a smaller discrepancy between average scores.
